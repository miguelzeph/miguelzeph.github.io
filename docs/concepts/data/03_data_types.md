# 3. Data Types

## Overview

Data types refer to the categories of data that determine what kind of value can be stored and manipulated within a program. Understanding data types is crucial for ensuring that data is stored correctly and for performing accurate operations.

## When to Study

Data types can be studied either in parallel with or after Data Structures. A solid understanding of data types enhances your ability to work with different kinds of data and to implement operations effectively.

## Objectives

- **Ensure Correct Data Storage:** Properly store and manage various types of data.
- **Perform Accurate Operations:** Carry out operations on data with appropriate precision and correctness.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Primitive Data Types

- **Description:** Basic types of data built into a programming language. They represent single values and have a fixed size.
- **Examples:**
  - **Integer (int):** Represents whole numbers. E.g., `5`, `-23`.
  - **Floating Point (float, double):** Represents real numbers with decimal points. E.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`.
  - **Character (char):** Represents a single character. E.g., `'A'`, `'z'`.
  - **Boolean (bool):** Represents true or false values. E.g., `true`, `false`.

### 2. Composite Data Types

- **Description:** Data types that are composed of multiple primitive types.
- **Examples:**
  - **String:** Represents a sequence of characters. E.g., `"Hello, World!"`.
  - **Array:** Represents a collection of elements of the same type. E.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - **Struct (C/C++), Class (Object-Oriented Languages):** User-defined types that group together different data types. E.g., a `Person` struct with `name` and `age` fields.

### 3. Abstract Data Types

- **Description:** Data types that are defined by their behavior (operations) rather than their implementation.
- **Examples:**
  - **List:** An ordered collection of elements that can be dynamically sized.
  - **Queue:** A collection that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.
  - **Stack:** A collection that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.
  - **Map (or Dictionary):** A collection of key-value pairs.

### 4. Special Data Types

- **Description:** Data types used for specific purposes or with special constraints.
- **Examples:**
  - **Date and Time:** Represents dates and times. E.g., `2024-08-29`, `12:00:00`.
  - **Enumeration (enum):** Represents a set of named values. E.g., `enum Days { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, ... }`.
  - **Null:** Represents the absence of a value. E.g., `null` in Java or `None` in Python.

## Conclusion

Understanding data types is essential for correct data handling and manipulation. By mastering data types, you can ensure that your programs store and process data accurately and efficiently.
