## 1. Pagination

### Purpose
Pagination helps manage and reduce API load by sending only the necessary data per request, avoiding the transfer of large data volumes all at once.

### Implementation
1. **Pagination Types**:
   - **Offset-based**: Sends a limited number of records per page with `limit` and `offset` parameters. Example: `GET /items?limit=10&offset=20`.
   - **Cursor-based**: Uses a reference ID for the next page, ensuring better consistency with large datasets. Example: `GET /items?cursor=abc123`.

2. **Common Parameters**:
   - `limit`: Defines the maximum number of records per page.
   - `offset` or `cursor`: Specifies the starting point for the next page of data.

### Best Practices
- Limit the maximum number of records per page to prevent large payloads.
- Allow clients to specify the number of records within a predefined range.

## 2. Asynchronous Logging

### Purpose
Synchronous logging can be time-consuming and, if done within the request-response cycle, impacts performance. Asynchronous logging helps avoid blocking, freeing the server to respond quickly to the client.

### Implementation
- **Asynchronous Logging Libraries**: Use libraries like `asyncio` or configure asynchronous logging in frameworks and languages that support it.
- **Logging Queues**: Set up a queue system (such as Kafka or RabbitMQ) to record logs outside the request cycle.

### Best Practices
- Set log levels properly (debug, info, warning, error) and avoid verbose logging in production.
- Log only essential information to prevent overload and excessive storage usage.

## 3. Caching

### Purpose
Caching stores responses for frequently accessed data, reducing server load and decreasing response times.

### Implementation
- **Cache Layer**: Use tools like Redis or Memcached for caching data.
- **HTTP Caching Headers**:
   - `Cache-Control`: Defines cache rules for clients and proxies.
   - `ETag`: Allows clients to validate if cached data is still valid.
   - `Expires`: Specifies an expiration date for the cache.

### Best Practices
- Consider data volatility when setting cache lifetimes. More dynamic data should have shorter cache durations, while static data can be cached for longer.
- Set up an invalidation system for frequently changing data to prevent stale cache.

## 4. Payload Compression

### Purpose
Payload compression reduces the size of data transferred between client and server, speeding up response times and lowering bandwidth usage.

### Implementation
- **Compression Methods**: Enable GZIP or Brotli on the server to compress JSON and other payload formats.
- **Compression Configuration**: Most frameworks allow automatic compression for specific content types.

### Best Practices
- Compress payloads that exceed a minimum size (e.g., 1 KB) to avoid unnecessary overhead on small data.
- Ensure clients are compatible with the chosen compression through the `Accept-Encoding` header in the request.

## 5. Connection Pooling

### Purpose
Connection pooling improves efficiency by reusing network connections, reducing latency, and enhancing scalability in high-concurrency scenarios.

### Implementation
- **Libraries and Tools**: Use tools that manage pooling automatically, such as `requests.Session` in Python or database frameworks with built-in connection pooling.
- **Pool Configuration**: Set pool size and connection lifetime, adjusting according to system load.

### Best Practices
- Monitor pool size and adjust based on load and server resources.
- Configure timeouts for idle connections to prevent resource waste.
