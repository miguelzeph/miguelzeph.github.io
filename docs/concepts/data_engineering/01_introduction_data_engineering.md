## Rationale for the Sequence

This order enables students to progress logically, beginning with foundational knowledge and moving towards more advanced and specialized topics. For example, understanding data types and structures is essential before approaching data modeling, which is in turn crucial for comprehending database systems, and so on.

Additionally, this structure mirrors the typical data flow within many organizations: from initial data collection and storage to processing, analysis, and ultimately data-driven decision making.
