# 2. ETL vs. ELT: Understanding Data Integration Processes - parte 1

Data integration is crucial in modern data management, especially in big data environments. Two common processes used for data integration are **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**. While they share similar steps, they differ in the sequence and environment in which data transformations are applied.

## 1. What are ETL and ELT?

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
ETL is a process where data is extracted from source systems, transformed to fit business needs (`processed data`), and then loaded into a destination, usually a `database`.

1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from `various sources`, such as **databases, APIs, Webscraping** or **files**.
2. **Transform**: Extracted data is transformed to meet business rules and formatting requirements. This may include data cleaning, aggregation, or enrichment.
3. **Load**: Transformed data is loaded into the target system, typically a data warehouse or database, ready for analysis.

**Advantages of ETL:**

- Ensures data is clean and conforms to business requirements before loading, facilitating consistent and accurate analysis.
- Ideal for databases with lower `processing capacity`, as transformations occur `outside` the destination database, reducing processing load on the target system.

**Disadvantages of ETL:**]

- The transformation process can be slow with large data volumes since it occurs before loading.
- Less flexibility for ad-hoc analysis, as data is pre-processed and transformed.

### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
ELT is a process that loads `raw data` directly into the target system, often a data lake or a cloud `data warehouse`, and then applies `transformations within`  as needed. This approach leverages the processing power of modern data warehouses to perform transformations after loading.

1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from source systems, similar to ETL.
2. **Load**: Data is loaded in its raw form into the destination, such as a data lake or cloud data warehouse.
3. **Transform**: After loading, transformations are applied within the data warehouse, using its processing capabilities to clean and format the data.

**Advantages of ELT:**

- Takes advantage of the scalability and processing power of cloud-based systems, allowing for rapid loading of large datasets.
- More suitable for ad-hoc analysis and big data environments, as raw data is available for various types of processing.

**Disadvantages of ELT:**

- Requires more processing capacity and a robust data warehouse, which may increase costs.
- Raw data can consume more storage and may lead to processing delays if transformations are complex.

## 5. Choosing Between ETL and ELT

When deciding between ETL and ELT, consider the following:

- **Data Volume**: ELT is preferable for large datasets that require cloud scalability.
- **Transformation Needs**: ETL is ideal when complex data transformations are necessary before analysis.
- **Infrastructure**: ETL suits on-premises setups, whereas ELT leverages cloud computing.
- **Budget**: While ETL is often more cost-effective for smaller projects, ELT can provide greater flexibility and scalability over time.

## 6. Python Tooling for ETL and ELT Projects

### ETL Tools
In an ETL project, transformations occur before data reaches the destination. Common tools include:

- **Python**: General-purpose scripting.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database interaction.
- **Airflow**: Pipeline orchestration and scheduling.

### ELT Tools
In an ELT project, data is loaded first, and transformations happen within the destination, leveraging cloud power:

- **Snowflake/BigQuery**: Cloud data warehouses.
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: Transformation in the warehouse.
- **Airflow or Prefect**: ELT pipeline orchestration.

## 7. Summary of ETL vs ELT

- **ETL**: Commonly used with traditional databases where transformations occur before the final load. 
- **ELT**: Suited for modern data warehouses, allowing in-database transformations for scalability and flexibility.

Both ETL and ELT are essential in different scenarios. While ETL offers control and is suitable for structured data, ELT thrives in cloud environments with scalability and flexibility for various data types.
