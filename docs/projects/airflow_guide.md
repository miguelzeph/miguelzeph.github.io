# Airflow Guide

This guide helps set up Apache Airflow using Virtualenv, installing dependencies, and creating the necessary environment variables for the project. It explains the key components of Airflow, such as DAGs (workflows), Tasks (units of work), and Operators (task logic). It shows how to start Airflow locally, including the database, web server, and scheduler for study purposes. Additionally, the guide highlights best practices for modifying configuration variables using env vars instead of directly editing the airflow.cfg file. The basic project structure and example DAGs are also provided.
