# Train Your Classifier


This project provides a simple and effective way to train a machine learning model for **image classification** using Python and TensorFlow. The goal is to build a model that can automatically classify images into various categories, such as animals, objects, or custom classes.

With the rise of machine learning and deep learning techniques, image classification has become a powerful tool in a variety of fields, including healthcare, security, and entertainment. This project allows you to harness that power by training your own classification model.

## Project Overview

By following this guide, you will:

- Set up the development environment, including Jupyter Notebook, to easily experiment and visualize data.
- Prepare a dataset for training, organized by categories (e.g., cats, dogs, birds).
- Train a TensorFlow model to classify images using deep learning.
- Optionally enhance your model's performance using **transfer learning** with pre-trained models.
- Save the trained model and integrate it into your projects, allowing automated image recognition.

This project provides an easy way to train a machine learning model for image classification using Python and TensorFlow.
