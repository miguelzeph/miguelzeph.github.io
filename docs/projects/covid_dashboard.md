# COVID-19 Data Dashboard

The `COVID-19 Data Dashboard` is an interactive **Python** application developed with **Streamlit** for real-time visualization and analysis of COVID-19 data. Users can select specific countries like Germany, Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and China, view interactive charts, and access detailed statistics on cases and deaths.

Key features include country selection, various data visualization options with line, scatter, and bar charts, and summary statistics such as total cases, deaths, mortality rate, and averages for new cases and deaths. The dashboard also offers a date range control for flexible data analysis over different periods, with dynamic updates based on user inputs.

The project utilizes **Python 3.11**, **Streamlit** for the user interface, Pandas for data manipulation, Plotly for creating interactive charts, and Requests to fetch real-time data. It is easy to install and run with simple steps provided in the project documentation, making it a practical tool for understanding the evolution of COVID-19 across different countries and timelines.
