# Minute News - Flask

This project demonstrates how to use Flask to build a news website efficiently. It automates the process of updating news content and allows you to manage everything from your local machine. You can easily update the database and deploy changes without long deployment times, ensuring a smooth and quick process.

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python that allows for easy development and deployment of web applications.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store news articles and related data, enabling flexible data management and quick retrieval of information.

- **NewsAPI**: Utilized to fetch the latest news articles from various sources, providing a comprehensive feed of current events and topics.

- **Web Scraping**:
    - An automated web scraping tool is implemented to extract additional information that may not be fully processed by the API. This ensures that users receive the most relevant and updated content directly from the source pages.
    - Another web scraping mechanism is employed to use online summarization tools to condense news articles. This is done to reduce processing load on local machines, allowing the use of less powerful hardware for efficient performance.
